 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

## Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is a submission-ready internship project designed to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. This machine learning solution helps farmers and agricultural planners make informed, data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and reduce financial risk.

---

## Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on traditional knowledge or trial-and-error methods to select crops. This can lead to poor yield, soil degradation, and financial losses. Manual assessment of soil and climate suitability is difficult and time-consuming. A data-driven crop prediction system provides a faster, scientific, and scalable solution.

## Solution

This project uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and weather parameters. Key highlights include:

* 🔹 Data-driven crop prediction
* 🔹 Supervised classification using Random Forest
* 🔹 High model accuracy (99.32%)
* 🔹 Simple and user-friendly Streamlit web application
* 🔹 Fast and reliable real-time predictions

---

## Tech Stack

* 🐍 Python
* 📊 NumPy & Pandas for data handling
* 🤖 Scikit-learn for Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
* 💾 Joblib for model saving
* 🌐 Streamlit for web application
* 💻 VS Code for development

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains soil and environmental parameters required for crop prediction:

* 🌱 Nitrogen (N)
* 🌿 Phosphorus (P)
* 🌾 Potassium (K)
* 🌡️ Temperature
* 💧 Humidity
* 🧪 Soil pH
* 🌧️ Rainfall

The target variable is crop label, representing the most suitable crop such as:

* 🌾 Rice
* 🌽 Maize
* ☕ Coffee
* 🌻 Cotton
* 🌿 Wheat
* And many more
